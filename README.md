This is a vanilla javascript calculator made as an assignment for Odin Project curriculum.
It is based on a similar calculator I made as part of FreeCodeCamp React course.
Another key difference besides React involvement is that FCC calculator evaluates expression as a whole with regard to PEMDAS rules. BUT it does so through `eval()` function.
Odin however advises against `eval()` but allows to calculate expressions step by step.
So this is what this calculator does.
